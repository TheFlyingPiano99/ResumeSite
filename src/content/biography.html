      Hi, I'm Zoli! I study computer engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
      Having successfully completed the undergraduate program I am currently pursuing master's degree.
      My main interests are computer graphics and creating video games.
      I also like everything creative such as writing my own music.
      If you would like to learn more about my work, please feel free to explore this site.
