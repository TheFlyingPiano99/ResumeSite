        I was born in the year 1999 in Lučenec (Losonc), in the Slovak Republic.
        Although my citizenship in slovak my nationality is hungarian.
        I took part in numerous science contests since primary school.
        I went to middle school in Fiľakovo (Fülek) which town is my current place of residence.
        I am grateful for my math skills to my mother who is a mathematics teacher in primary school
        and equally grateful to my father for my programming skills who is working as a software developer.
        During the middle school years of my life I was focused on playing the piano.
        My efforts in the field of music were acknowledged on multiple regional and countrywide competitions.
        After middle school I decided to continue my studies in Hungary.
        In the beginning of the year 2023 I earned a bachelor's degree in computer engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
        In my B.Sc. thesis I wrote about my volumetric rendering software, which is capable of visualizing CT, MRI or other 3D datasets.
        As an undergraduate student I gained work experience by working at Tata Consultancy Services for 8 months.
        I also worked as teaching assistant at the university.
        In 2021 I reached III. placement at the universities Scientific Students' Associations Conference
        for the work Visualization of relativistic phenomena.
        I also gave a presentation about this work at the GrafGeo scientific conference in 2022.
        Later in 2022 I reached first place at the Functional programming in C++ student contest held on the university.
        Currently I am persuing master's degree at the same institution.
        During the M.Sc. program my main specialisation is in the field of visual informatics and my secondary specialisation is quantum informatics.
